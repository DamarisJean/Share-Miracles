                        Let me start by sharing the story of how this place came
                        to be. As a Christian, I have always wanted to
                        experience miracles. However, I noticed that many
                        people, myself included, often feel shy or unsure about
                        sharing these personal moments. We may lack a supportive
                        community to turn to, or simply feel hesitant to share
                        our experiences with others.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-7 mt-4">
                        This realization sparked the idea for this website, a
                        place where you can feel comfortable sharing your
                        miracles.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-7 mt-4">
                        The vision I had in mind is a place to inspire and
                        uplift others, creating a deeper connection with God.
                        Reading stories that open your eyes to the wonders
                        around you, encouraging you to stay aware and inspired.
                        This is that placeâ€”a community where you are free to
                        share anything you wish, from brief moments of grace to
                        life-changing events. Here, you are welcomed with open
                        arms to feel free, connected, and inspired.

                    <p className="text-lg leading-7">
                        Before my journey to becoming a developer, I started
                        writing miracles in a small notepad. After finishing my
                        bootcamp, I thought it would be a great idea to have a
                        place where everyone could write on this "notepad". So,
                        I decided to develop this website. After many struggles
                        and restarting at least twice, I decided it was time to
                        host the website so I could share it with others.
                    </p>

                    <p className="text-lg leading-7 mt-4">
                        I will keep working on this project, adding new
                        features, exploring ideas, and growing alongside it. I
                        hope that in years to come, I can look back on this
                        moment and remember the experience fondly.

                        Thank you for being here, and I hope you find this space
                        as comforting and inspiring as I envisioned it to be.
